After Reader - Do not let your reading habit die with Google Reader!
========================
This chrome extension points the reader link (top black bar on all google products) to your choice of feed reader.
You can either choose from some existing readers or add your own.

Overview
--------
I and many more people have been using Google Reader and love it since years 
but unfortunately, Google has decided to shut it down. Luckily, we have some of the 
good alternatives available that we can use. But again, we can not access that from 
Google's black top bar. And hence my effort goes not to break that habit.

Even after Google removes the reader link on 1st July onward, this extension will keep 
the link there but point to your choice of feed reader. Enjoy!

Installation
-------------------------

Just install the extension from [the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/manomhglbnajhecamckphhpojakbbdle).
